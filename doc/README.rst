Documentation
=============

This directory contains documentation for the framework.  It is written
using `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>_.

On many systems with Python installed, Sphinx can be installed with::

    $ easy_install sphinx

Thus documentation can then be built in HTML format by running ``make html``::

    $ cd doc
    $ make html

The index page will be written to ``doc/build/html/index.html``.
